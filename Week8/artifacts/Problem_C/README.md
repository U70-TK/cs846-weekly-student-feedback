# LibraryTracker — Debugging Assignment

A small Python pipeline that loads library book and checkout data from CSV files, then generates three operational reports: late fee calculations, genre availability summaries, and a most-checked-out ranking.

## Structure

```
LibraryTracker/
├── main.py                      ← Pipeline entry point
├── tracker/
│   ├── loader.py                ← Stage 1: CSV ingestion & field derivation
│   └── reports.py               ← Stage 2: Late fees, genre stats, top books
├── data/
│   ├── books.csv                ← 10 books across 7 genres
│   └── checkouts.csv            ← 12 checkout records (some overdue)
├── output/                      ← Generated by main.py
│   ├── late_fees.json
│   ├── availability_by_genre.json
│   └── most_checked_out.json
└── tests/
    └── validate.py              ← Correctness checker (run after main.py)
```

## Quick Start

```bash
python3 main.py            # run the (buggy) pipeline
python3 tests/validate.py  # check your fixes — all 10 checks must PASS
```

## Expected Output (post-fix)

```
Report Complete
   Overdue/late checkouts : 7
   Still unreturned       : 3
   Total fees owed        : $8.75
   Genres tracked         : 7
```
