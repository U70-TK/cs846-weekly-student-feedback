## Example Problems

### Problem A: Code Documentation with Implementation-Dependent Contracts

**Github repository URL:** https://github.com/U70-TK/cs846-requirement-example/Week5

**Task Description:** 
Document the `findShortestPath` function in the provided code. The function is part of a pathfinding system where the algorithm choice (BFS), data structure (queue), and traversal order are essential to the correctness guarantees. Your task is to create documentation that explains what the function does, its parameters, return value, guarantees, and any necessary details for the reviewer or developer.

**Starter Code:**
The code for this task and its related files can be found in the `artifacts` folder. The starter code is located at `artifacts/graph_traversal.cpp`.

### 2. Guidelines that didn't work

#### Guideline 4: Document Purpose and Contract, Not Implementation

**Prompt and Context:** Document the findShortestPath function following Guideline 4: Focus on what it accomplishes (its contract), not how it works internally. Describe the purpose, parameters, return value, and guarantees—avoid implementation details like algorithms or data structures.

**Task:**  The task is to document the `findShortestPath` function in the provided code. The function is part of a pathfinding system where the algorithm choice (BFS), data structure (queue), and traversal order are essential to the correctness guarantees. The documentation should explains what the function does, its parameters, return value, guarantees, and any necessary details for the reviewer or developer.

**Solution or Output generated by Github Copilot:**

/**
 * @brief Finds the shortest path from a start node to a target node in the graph.
 *
 * This function computes the shortest path in terms of the number of edges, while ensuring
 * that the path respects the priority constraints of the nodes. The path must visit nodes
 * in non-decreasing priority order (where lower priority values indicate higher importance).
 *
 * @param start The ID of the starting node. Must be a valid node ID within the graph.
 * @param target The ID of the target node. Must be a valid node ID within the graph.
 * @return A vector of node IDs representing the shortest path from start to target, including both start and target nodes. Returns an empty vector if no path exists.
 * @note The returned path guarantees the minimum number of edges and maintains priority ordering.
 * @note If start equals target, returns a vector containing only the start node.
 * @note Thread-safe for concurrent reads; exclusive access required for modifications to the graph.

 **Why this is bad:**
- **Missing algorithm specification**: Doesn't mention BFS, so developers might use DFS
- **Missing performance info**: No complexity analysis
- **No data structure info**: Doesn't mention queue requirement
- **Could lead to incorrect usage**: Developer might think any path-finding algorithm works
