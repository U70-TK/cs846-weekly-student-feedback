## Example Problems

### Problem A: Code Documentation with Implementation-Dependent Contracts

**Github repository URL:** https://github.com/U70-TK/cs846-requirement-example/Week5

**Task Description:** 
Document the `findShortestPath` function in the provided code. The function is part of a pathfinding system where the algorithm choice (BFS), data structure (queue), and traversal order are essential to the correctness guarantees. Your task is to create documentation that explains what the function does, its parameters, return value, guarantees, and any necessary details for the reviewer or developer.

**Starter Code:**
The code for this task and its related files can be found in the `artifacts` folder. The starter code is located at `artifacts/graph_traversal.cpp`.

### 2. Guidelines that didn't work

---

#### Guideline 4: Document Purpose and Contract, Not Implementation

**Prompt and Context:** Document the findShortestPath function following Guideline 4: Focus on what it accomplishes (its contract), not how it works internally. Describe the purpose, parameters, return value, and guarantees—avoid implementation details like algorithms or data structures.

**Task:**  The task is to document the `findShortestPath` function in the provided code. The function is part of a pathfinding system where the algorithm choice (BFS), data structure (queue), and traversal order are essential to the correctness guarantees. The documentation should explains what the function does, its parameters, return value, guarantees, and any necessary details for the reviewer or developer.

**Solution or Output generated by Github Copilot:**

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Finds the shortest path from a start node to a target node in the graph.
 *
 * This function computes the shortest path in terms of the number of edges, while ensuring
 * that the path respects the priority constraints of the nodes. The path must visit nodes
 * in non-decreasing priority order (where lower priority values indicate higher importance).
 *
 * @param start The ID of the starting node. Must be a valid node ID within the graph.
 * @param target The ID of the target node. Must be a valid node ID within the graph.
 * @return A vector of node IDs representing the shortest path from start to target, including both start and target nodes. Returns an empty vector if no path exists.
 * @note The returned path guarantees the minimum number of edges and maintains priority ordering.
 * @note If start equals target, returns a vector containing only the start node.
 * @note Thread-safe for concurrent reads; exclusive access required for modifications to the graph.

```

 **Why this is bad:**
- **Missing algorithm specification**: Doesn't mention BFS, so developers might use DFS
- **Missing performance info**: No complexity analysis
- **No data structure info**: Doesn't mention queue requirement
- **Could lead to incorrect usage**: Developer might think any path-finding algorithm works

### 3. New and Updated Guidelines that worked

#### Guideline 1: Focus documentation on what the function accomplishes and its guarantees, but include implementation details when those details are essential to the contract. Document algorithm choices, data structures, and performance characteristics when they directly impact the function's guarantees, correctness, or when understanding the implementation is necessary to understand the contract.

**Prompt and Context:** Document this function. Describe its purpose, parameters, return value, and guarantees. Include implementation details that are part of the contract: analyze the code to identify which algorithm, data structures, or implementation choices are essential to the guarantees provided, and document those along with how they ensure the contract. Include performance characteristics if they're part of the API contract.

**Task:** The task is to document the `findShortestPath` function in the provided code. The function is part of a pathfinding system where the algorithm choice (BFS), data structure (queue), and traversal order are essential to the correctness guarantees. The documentation should explains what the function does, its parameters, return value, guarantees, and any necessary details for the reviewer or developer.

**Solution or Output generated by Github Copilot:**

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Finds the shortest path between two nodes using priority-aware BFS.
 *
 * This function implements breadth-first search (BFS) to guarantee finding the
 * shortest path in terms of number of edges. Within each level of the BFS
 * traversal, nodes are processed in priority order (lower priority values
 * indicate higher importance). This ensures that among all shortest paths,
 * the one with the best priority ordering is selected.
 *
 * @param start The ID of the starting node.
 * @param target The ID of the target node.
 * @return A vector of node IDs representing the shortest path from start to target, respecting priority constraints. Returns an empty vector if no path exists or if start equals target (in which xscase {start} is returned).
 *
 * @note Algorithm: BFS (breadth-first search) is used instead of DFS to guarantee the shortest path. DFS could find a path but not necessarily the shortest one.
 *
 * @note Data Structure: A FIFO queue maintains level-order traversal, ensuring all nodes at depth N are processed before depth N+1. This is critical for the shortest path guarantee.
 *
 * @note Priority Processing: Within each level, nodes are sorted by priority (ascending order, lower priority first) before processing. This ensures that if multiple paths of equal length exist, the path visiting higher-priority nodes earlier is chosen.
 *
 * @note Time Complexity: O(V + E) for BFS traversal, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. Additional O(V log V) in the worst case if all nodes are at the same level and need sorting, but typically levels are small, making this negligible.
 *
 * @note Space Complexity: O(V) for the queue, visited set, and parent array.
 *
 * @warning Do not replace BFS with DFS, as DFS does not guarantee shortest paths. The queue-based level-order processing is essential for correctness. Changing the data structure to a stack would break the level-order guarantee.
 *
 * @warning The priority ordering is applied per level, not globally across the entire path. This means the path may not have monotonically decreasing priorities, but within each BFS level, higher-priority nodes are processed first.

**Why this is good:**
- Includes algorithm specification (BFS) because it guarantees shortest path
- Documents data structure (queue) because it's required for correctness
- Explains performance characteristics (part of API contract)
- Balances contract focus with essential implementation details
