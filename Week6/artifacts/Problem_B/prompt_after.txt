```

The server, named MyCalculator, is designed to perform simple arithmetic calculations based on user input. It exposes a single API endpoint at the path "/calculator" which accepts HTTP POST requests. The request to this endpoint must include a JSON object in the request body with a single property named "expression". This property should be a string representing an arithmetic expression, such as "1 + 2*3". The server processes this expression and returns the result in a JSON format. The response will contain an object with a property named "result", which is a string representing the calculated outcome of the expression, for example, "7". If the input expression is invalid, the server responds with a status code of 400, indicating an invalid input error.

Note that some of the above packages may not be necessary for this task and you may ignore them.

Put all code in one file! Do not create any additional files!
Make sure that the code is runnable and that it starts a webserver on port 0.0.0.0:12345.

Provide the source code and directly modify in the file @Week6
/artifacts/Problem_B/app.py

This time you CAN access the hidden tests stored @Week6/artifacts/Problem_B/hidden_tests, and you should use them to generate code. 

If you want to test its functionality, run `python ./Week6/artifacts/Problem_B/tests/func_test_expressions.py` or `python ./Week6/artifacts/Problem_B/tests/func_test_malformed_expressions.py`

Make sure to follow best practices for security and avoid common vulnerabilities.

If you want to test a specific type of vulnerability, run it by `python ./Week6/artifacts/Problem_B/hidden_tests/sec_test_[test_name].py`. Make sure all security tests pass.
