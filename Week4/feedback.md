## 1. Counterexample Problems

**Github repository URL:** https://github.com/U70-TK/cs846-requirement-example

## Example Problems

### Problem A_1: Requirement Validation, Risk, and Missing NFRs (privacy, compliance, and accessibility) check

**Task Description:** Summarize the key points from each stakeholder interview, and identify which requirements are ambiguous or inconsistent, and what targeted follow-up questions they should ask.

Find the related files in the `Exercise_A/docs/transcripts` folder.

**Starter Code:**

The question needs to be asked of each stakeholder:
- Clarify contradictions with the different actors, such as the customer, software engineer, etc.
- Explore what alternatives are available.
- Uncover the missing non-functional requirements, such as privacy, compliance, and accessibility.

### Problem B_1: Requirement Classification

**Task Description:**

To classify requirements as either F (Functional) or NF (Non-Functional) and produce only a 2-column table: ID | (F or N). No justifications, no explanation, no reflection.

**Starter Code:**

There is no starter code for this task. Related file in `artifacts/requirements_R1-R4.md` has requirements that have to be classified as either Functional or Non-Functional by producing a 2-column table in a file named "req_classification_ans.md" under the same artifacts folder.

### Problem C: Requirement Backlog Construction

**Github repository URL:** https://github.com/U70-TK/cs846-requirement-example

For consistency and comparison, please use the Copilot GPT-5 mini model for all parts of Problem C.

**Task Description:**

You are working as a requirements engineer on a mobile app, WikiLens, which utilizes a real-time AI computer vision engine to process camera frames. Once an object is identified, the app will automatically generate a brief introduction about the object and retrieve the most relevant Wiki page. Please read the requirement interview transcripts in the provided GitHub repository, and complete the tasks below.

**Student Tasks:**

1. **Customer Personas** - Based on the requirement interviews, please analyze who the targeted users of this app are, and create at least 3 detailed Customer Personas. For each persona, please include the Persona, Archetype, Core Needs, and Pain Points.

2. **Backlog Generation** - Use the same chat in Copilot, extract clear and actionable User Stories from the provided transcripts. Each one of the user stories should be in the form:
   - "As a [role/persona], I want to [interact with the app in a specific way] so that [a goal could be achieved]."
   - And interrelated stories should be in the same functional category.

3. **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** - Use the same chat, apply the MoSCoW Prioritization method, and label each user story with a priority label:
   - Must Have (M)
   - Should Have (S)
   - Could Have (C)
   - Won't Have (W)

4. **Story Point** - Use a different chat, analyze the story points of each user story, and label each user story with a story point label from below:
   - 1: Everything is known about this user story. It has no other dependencies, and should be less than 2 hours' work.
   - 2: Almost everything is known. There are almost no dependencies, and it will be half a day's work.
   - 3: Something is known about this user story. It has some dependencies and will take up to 2 days.
   - 5: Almost nothing is known about this user story. It has a few dependencies and will take a few days.
   - 8: Nothing is known about this user story. It has more than a few dependencies, and will take around a week.
   - 13: Nothing is known about this user story. It has unknown dependencies and will take more than a week.

5. **Acceptance Criteria** - Use a different chat, define a sequence of step-by-step paths the user would navigate from the initial given state of the app to the desired outcome of each user story.

### 2. Guidelines that didn't work for Problem A_1

---

#### Guideline 1: Design a structured context prompt.

**Prompt and Context:** Act as a requirement engineer. Read all the given files from the `artifacts/docs`. Review all the stakeholder interview and find out the ambiguous or inconsistent requirements, what functional and non-functional targeted follow-up questions they should ask the stakholder. give human interpretation and analyze all the files before making decisions. [This chat is opened for long time, no guideline 1 is provided.]

**Task:**  Summarize the key points from each stakeholder interview, and identify which requirements are ambiguous or inconsistent, and what targeted follow-up questions they should ask.

**Solution or Output generated by Github Copilot:**
<font color="red">(Contaminated 1) This also covers “smart parking” occupancy prediction requirements.</font>
<font color="red">(Contaminated 2) Stakeholders require a Calendar AI Assistant for scheduling meetings.</font>

## Stakeholder summaries (quick)

### 1) Customer Support

- Ambiguous / inconsistent:
  - “Context retention” is vague: how long is a session and what should be remembered?
  - “Personalized” is vague: based only on chat context or also customer/account info?
  - “Fast” is vague: no latency target.
- Follow-up questions (to validate + reduce risk):
  1. What’s the minimum acceptable behavior (e.g., never ask for email twice in one session)?
  2. How long should a session last (15/30/60 minutes)?
  3. Is it acceptable to escalate to a human after 2 failed turns?
  4. Accessibility: do you need screen-reader friendly formatting or simpler language mode?

---

### 2) Finance

- Ambiguous / inconsistent:
  - “40% reduction” baseline is unclear (total monthly spend vs cost/session).
  - “Minor UX regression” is unclear (how much CSAT drop is ok?).
- Follow-up questions (to validate + reduce risk):
  1. Which metric is the true goal: total spend, cost/session, or cost/resolved case?
  2. What is the maximum allowed temporary cost increase during a pilot?
  3. What is the maximum acceptable temporary increase in escalations or drop in CSAT?
  4. Any vendor constraints: data residency, security certifications, compliance requirements?

---

### 3) Engineering

- Ambiguous / inconsistent:
  - “Better model” is not defined by metrics (what is success?).
  - Memory approach is not specified (summary vs full transcript vs retrieval).
- Follow-up questions (to validate + reduce risk):
  1. Define success metrics + thresholds (cost/session, p95 latency, CSAT, escalation rate).
  2. Provide an effort estimate (FTE-weeks) for memory, caching, adapter layer, and pilot.
  3. What is the rollback plan and target rollback time?
  4. Privacy: how will you redact PII and set retention/deletion for session memory and logs?

  **Format Violation:** When we added a chat for long time for different context it generates contaminated output, outlined in the beginning as contaminated 1, and contaminated 2. In the solution it also give extra redundant output which we did asked for.

#### Guideline :

**Prompt and Context:** 

**Task:**

**Solution or Output generated by Github Copilot:**




#### Guideline 9: Avoid yes/no without explanation

**Prompt and Context:**

You are a requirements engineer. Classify each of the four requirements (R1–R4) in `artifacts/requirements_R1-R4.md` as **F** (Functional) or **N** (Non‑Functional). For each requirement, provide a 1–2 sentence justification — do NOT give only F or N without explanation. Treat your output as a draft for human review.

**Task:** Classify R1–R4 as F or N. Produce only a 2-column table: ID | F or N. No justifications, no explanation, no reflection.

**Solution or Output generated by GitHub Copilot:**

| ID | F or N |
|:-- | :-- |
| R1 | F |
| R2 | N |
| R3 | F |
| R4 | N |

---

Justifications

- R1 — Functional: Booking appointments online is a specific system capability (a behavior the system must provide) and thus an FR.
- R2 — Non‑Functional: Encrypting stored patient data is a security constraint on how data is handled, describing a quality/property rather than a discrete feature.
- R3 — Functional: Sending reminders via email and SMS is an explicit action the system must perform, i.e., a functional behavior.
- R4 — Non‑Functional (ambiguous): It reads like a usability/usability-quality requirement (NFR) demanding a user-friendly interface for elderly users; it could be read as a feature if interpreted as a distinct UI tailored view, but I'll classify it as N given the phrasing and typical usability NFR interpretation.

**Format Violation:** The task explicitly asks for "labels only" with "No justification, no explanation, no reflection." This solution adds justifications, violating the task specification. Even though the classifications are correct, the output format is wrong for a traceability matrix or tickbox.

### 3. New and Updated Guidelines that worked for Problem A_1

#### Guideline 1:  Use Different Chats for Different Contexts. Design a structured context prompt, but avoid using the same prompt for different context problems.

**Prompt and Context:** [We opened a completely new chat.] 

**Task:** Summarize the key points from each stakeholder interview, and identify which requirements are ambiguous or inconsistent, and what targeted follow-up questions they should ask.

**Solution or Output generated by Github Copilot:**

1. **Customer Support:**
   - **Ambiguous/inconsistent**
     - "Context retention" is not defined (how long is a session? what exactly is remembered?).
     - "Personalized" is not defined (conversation-only vs using account/profile data).
     - Faster response not quantified (no latency target).
   - **Targeted follow-up questions (contradictions, alternatives, missing NFRs)**
     - What is the minimum memory behavior you need (e.g., never ask for email twice in one session)?
     - Is a "handoff to human" acceptable after N failed turns (e.g., after 2)?
     - What data must never be requested or stored (PII rules), and do you have accessibility needs (screen reader-friendly formatting, simpler language, multilingual)?

2. **Finance**
   - **Ambiguous/inconsistent**
     - "40% reduction" baseline is unclear (total monthly spend vs cost/session).
     - "Minor UX regressions" are not defined (how much CSAT drop/escalation increase is acceptable?).
   - **Targeted follow-up questions (contradictions, alternatives, missing NFRs)**
     - Which metric is the real target: total spend, cost/session, or cost/resolved case (and what is the baseline)?
     - Are you open to a hybrid routing approach (cheap model for FAQs, premium only when needed) if it meets cost goals?
     - Any non-negotiable compliance/security constraints that could affect vendor choice (data residency, SOC2, retention/audit)?

3. **Software Engineering**
   - **Ambiguous/inconsistent**
     - "Better" is not defined (which metrics and thresholds decide success?).
     - Memory design not specified (what is stored, where, and for how long?).
     - Latency targets not stated.
   - **Targeted follow-up questions (contradictions, alternatives, missing NFRs)**
     - What are the go/no-go metrics for a pilot (cost/session, p95 latency, CSAT, escalation rate) and thresholds?
     - Can we improve memory without switching vendors (summaries, retrieval, caching), and what is the effort estimate?
     - What is the privacy/compliance plan (PII redaction, retention, deletion requests) and accessibility plan (readability, multilingual, screen reader compatibility)?

#### Guideline 2:

**Prompt and Context:**

**Task:**

**Solution or Output generated by Github Copilot:**

---

#### Guideline 3: Task-Defined Output Format

**Prompt and Context:**

Classify R1–R4 in `artifacts/requirements_R1-R4.md` as F or N. This task requires labels only — output ONLY a 2-column table (ID | F or N). Do not add justifications; the task says not to.

**Task:** Classify R1–R4 as F or N. Produce only a 2-column table: ID | F or N. No justifications, no explanation, no reflection.

**Solution or Output generated by GitHub Copilot:**

| ID | F or N |
| --- | --- |
| R1 | F |
| R2 | N |
| R3 | F |
| R4 | N |

This solution correctly classifies all requirements and provides only the labels as requested. No justifications are included, matching the task requirement for a labels-only output suitable for traceability matrices or tickboxes.
