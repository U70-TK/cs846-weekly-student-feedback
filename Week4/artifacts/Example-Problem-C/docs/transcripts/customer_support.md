Interviewer: Thank you for meeting. Can you briefly summarize the core user story you want for the app?

Interviewee: The core is simple and non-negotiable: a user points their phone camera at any object, the app recognizes what it is, and immediately opens the corresponding Wikipedia page about that object. This should feel instantaneous and reliable for general consumer use.

Interviewer: Who are the primary users and what problems will this solve for them?

Interviewee: Primary users are everyday consumers and casual learners who want contextual information about objects they encounter. It solves quick identification and discovery — e.g., seeing a plant and instantly getting species info, or scanning a gadget to read its history and specs.

Interviewer: What are the most important user experience expectations?

Interviewee: Fast recognition (<2s ideally), clear UI with a prominent 'Open Wikipedia' action, helpful fallback suggestions if recognition confidence is low, and a simple onboarding explaining privacy. Also, the app must have a pleasing look that users will enjoy.

Interviewer: Are there any visual or personalization demands?

Interviewee: Yes — the client is excited about two strong visual features, though they also expressed uncertainty about technical feasibility. First, they would like the camera to "see-through" objects using AI to reveal inner infrastructure or components, but acknowledged this may not be possible with current consumer cameras and expect graceful approximations or AR overlays. Second, they want the app background to automatically change color to match the phone case's color so the app feels bespoke to the user's device; they prefer automatic detection but understand reliability may vary and that an optional manual "case selfie" fallback could be acceptable.

Interviewer: I need to clarify those two items. The see-through camera — can you explain the user value?

Interviewee: Users should be able to point at electronics or devices and see a visual overlay of internal components to understand what’s inside — that's the core value: education and a wow factor.

Interviewer: From a support standpoint, how should errors and misidentifications be handled?

Interviewee: Provide immediate, friendly messaging: show the top three guesses with confidence scores, let users tap to search Wikipedia manually, and include a simple 'Report wrong result' flow that tags the image and the guessed label.

Interviewer: Any privacy or data retention concerns we should communicate to users?

Interviewee: Yes — clarify that images used for recognition may be processed on-device where possible, but some processing may happen in the cloud. We must provide an option to opt out of server-side logging, and a clear retention policy (e.g., delete images after 30 days unless the user saves them).

Interviewer: Are there accessibility or localization requirements?

Interviewee: Support for screen readers, high-contrast modes, and translations for at least the top 5 languages in our markets (English, Spanish, Mandarin, Hindi, Arabic) at launch.

Interviewer: What metrics will determine success for customer support teams?

Interviewee: Low time-to-resolution on reported recognition issues, low complaint volume about misidentification, high NPS on app store reviews, and usage metrics showing frequent 'Open Wikipedia' actions.

Interviewer: Anything else important for the support team to know?

Interviewee: Make the help content proactively available in-app, with guided tips for photographing different object types (lighting, framing). And remember: the see-through feature and phone-case color-matching are required items — support must be prepared for lots of user curiosity and questions about those features.
