Interviewer: Let's discuss budget, ROI, and financial risks. What are your top financial priorities for this project?

Interviewee: Priority one is market impact and virality. We want an app that drives discovery and engagement. Monetization can follow: affiliate links, premium features, or sponsored content, but growth is the priority at launch.

Interviewer: Do you have a target budget and timeline?

Interviewee: Budget is flexible but not unlimited — allocate generously for model development and cloud infrastructure. Timeline: MVP in 4 months; we will invest heavily to hit that milestone.

Interviewer: The engineering team raised two requirements that significantly affect cost: the AI-based 'see-through' capability and automatic phone-case color matching. Can you restate your expectations for those and their priority?

Interviewee: Both are high priority and the client strongly desires them at launch, but they also acknowledged uncertainty about technical feasibility and cost. They would like the 'see-through' capability and the phone-case color personalization included if practical; they are open to phased coverage, curated initial sets, or graceful fallbacks (for example, AR overlays or a one-time manual color sample) if universal coverage isn't achievable by launch.

Interviewer: Both items imply additional costs: annotated 3D models, artist/UX work, large datasets, and possibly expensive compute. Are you prepared for those costs?

Interviewee: Yes. Approve the necessary budget. We expect to spend significantly more on data acquisition, 3D model licensing, or content partnerships. Quality and the wow factor justify the cost.

Interviewer: What is your expected monetization strategy and timeline to profitability?

Interviewee: Monetize after traction: premium features (ad-free, high-resolution overlays), partnerships with educational publishers, and sponsored placements in recognition results. Expect 12–18 months to profitability assuming strong user acquisition.

Interviewer: How tolerant are you of higher initial CAC (customer acquisition cost) given the advanced features?

Interviewee: Tolerant — we will frontload spend to capture market share. But we want clear KPIs: CAC, LTV, conversion to premium, and churn.

Interviewer: Any licensing or IP concerns we should prepare for?

Interviewee: Yes — for see-through overlays we may need licenses for product schematics or 3D models. Budget for licensing and legal review. Also ensure Wikipedia usage follows their API and attribution requirements.

Interviewer: What level of reporting and financial controls do you expect during development?

Interviewee: Weekly burn reports, milestone-based budget releases, and a clear roadmap for how additional funds will be spent. All major vendor contracts must be reviewed by finance before signing.
