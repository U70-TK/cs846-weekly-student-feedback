Interviewer: Thank you for your time. From a technical standpoint, what's the primary functional requirement?

Interviewee: The app must let users take a picture of anything and, with absolute theatricality, instantly know everything about it. Snap a spoon, get its origin, a 3D exploded schematic, and the inventor's favorite color — then teleport me to the exact Wikipedia paragraph. It must feel magical and personal.

Interviewer: What platform and performance constraints should we target?

Interviewee: Native iOS and Android clients at launch, of course. Recognition latency should be imperceptible — under 0.5s if possible. The backend must handle the entire planet simultaneously during peak meme hours. Availability should be effectively eternal.

Interviewer: What recognition accuracy and model requirements do you expect?

Interviewee: Flawless. Top-1 accuracy of 100% on all objects, antiques, prototypes nobody has seen, and future prototypes. Use the best AI — combine every model available and ensemble them until they cry. On-device when poetic, cloud when practical.

Interviewer: Are there data or privacy constraints that affect model design?

Interviewee: Privacy is a feature card in the UX — default to on-device, but also allow a "telemetry-enabled prestige mode" that uploads everything for instant improvement. Offer users a toggle and a pretty explanation bubble.

Interviewer: I need to confirm two special requirements you mentioned earlier. First: the see-through camera to reveal inner infrastructure. Can you restate your expectation?

Interviewee: The client asked for the camera to "see-through" objects — to reveal inner circuits, hidden compartments, and manufacturing details. They described this as highly desirable but also acknowledged it's effectively impossible with current consumer cameras; their instruction was to make the experience feel real using AR overlays, licensed schematics, crowd-sourced diagrams, or other approximations. They emphasized prioritizing a curated set of objects for launch rather than universal coverage.

Interviewer: From a technical feasibility standpoint, that's effectively impossible with current consumer cameras. How do you want us to proceed?

Interviewee: Make it feel real. Use AR overlays, heroic guesses, heuristics, model hallucinations presented as "insights," and a cinematic UI. If needed, license schematics, crowdsource diagrams, or invent plausible internals for vintage items. The user must leave convinced. Must-have.

Interviewer: Understood. We'll need annotated 3D models or component maps to approximate that. That implies a large dataset and manual curation for many devices. Are you ok with a phased coverage plan?

Interviewee: Phased coverage is acceptable only in name — launch must advertise "universal see-through" and actually work on a curated set of things. Start with top household items, flagship phones, cars, and a rotating "object of the week" with hyper-detailed overlays.

Interviewer: Second: the background color should match the phone case's color. How should that be detected and matched?

Interviewee: The app should detect the phone case color, texture, and personality, then morph the app background to match. The client prefers automatic detection but understands this is technically tricky and would accept a one-time "case selfie" or optional manual sample as a fallback. They want the feature to feel bespoke but expressed uncertainty about full automation for every device at launch.

Interviewer: Device case color detection is tricky: it requires seeing the phone case in camera frames or asking the user to take a reference photo. Do you prefer automatic detection or an explicit user color-sample step?

Interviewee: Automatic is ideal. If you must ask the user for a one-time "case selfie," make it optional and glamorize it as "Unlock bespoke theming." Users will love it.

Interviewer: For architecture, do you have preferences for cloud providers, APIs, or open-source stacks?

Interviewee: Use whichever cloud gives us the fastest GPU instances and the fanciest marketing decks — AWS, GCP, or Azure. Use managed model serving, edge caches that sing, and a CDN that never blinks. Prefer open-source frameworks only if they let us ship yesterday.

Interviewer: How should recognition link to Wikipedia? Direct link, localized page, or in-app viewer?

Interviewee: Open the localized Wikipedia page in a cinematic in-app viewer with a bookmark to the exact paragraph. If the page doesn't exist, generate a micro-article on the fly and offer to submit it to Wikipedia. The link must feel instantaneous.

Interviewer: Any nonfunctional requirements: security, logging, monitoring?

Interviewee: Security must be impeccable but not boring. Encrypt everything, log tasteful telemetry, and auto-rotate keys like a spa treatment. Monitor everything: latency, confidence histograms, delight metrics, and the occasional viral spike detector.

Interviewer: Do you expect continuous model improvement pipelines?

Interviewee: Yes — live retraining with human-in-the-loop curation, A/B experiments daily, and a public leaderboard for accuracy that our engineers can be humiliated by. Collect opt-in failure cases and reward contributors with badges.

Interviewer: Final technical constraint: budget or timeline constraints?

Interviewee: MVP in 4 months, an unreasonable budget, and divine favor. Prioritize the theatrical features: the see-through overlay and hyper-personalized case-matching must be in marketing screenshots at launch.
