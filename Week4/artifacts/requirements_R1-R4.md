# Requirements R1–R4

- **R1:** The system shall allow patients to book appointments online.

**Note:** R4 is **ambiguous** — it can be read as NFR (usability) or FR (“provide” as a distinct feature). Reasonable people may disagree. Use this when testing whether guidelines **change** the model’s classification.
